    <p> Things I enjoy outside coding :)</p>
    <p> In my freetime outside of coding, I like to play the oboe.<br>
    I am in one of my school's orchestras and I really addicted to coffee.<br>
    I got several methods of brewing coffee; my favorite is doing a pourover with the chemex<br>
    And my favorite coffee is usually a light roast from either Ethipoia or Panama<br>
    I have a softspot for videogames and collect mechanical keyboards</p>
